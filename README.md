# Black Jack Card Game 🃏

For this exercise we had to recreate the classic BlackJack cardgame with Javascript. 


## ⌨️  Basic rules of the game
- Every card represents its numeric value. 
- Special cards count for 10, ace is just 1 
- You automatically lose if your total value is 22 or higher 
- Ultimate goal is to reach 21 (solo game) or to have a higher hand (21 or lower) than your opponent (playing vs computer)



## ⚙️  Tools used 
- Visual Studio Code(HTML, CSS, JS)
- Markdown
- Google, our best friend
- Flaticon.com, for icons


## 🌟  Must Have Features 
- The player can request a new card
    - You'll need to create a variable containing possible card options (focus on the numbers, we don't really care about the symbols for now)
    - The drawn card is shown on the screen (just a number to represent the card is enough for now, special cards can show as 10)
    - If a card is drawn, that one disappears from the pool
    - What html element can be best used to display a list of the users cards?
- Win conditions (21) or lose conditions are checked (22+)
- If player has won or lost, the game ends and a message is showing
- If not, the player can request a new card
- The dealers hand is always visible
- The player can stop (with a lower hand than 21), after which the dealer tries to beat him (= have a higher hand)
- After the players turn, the dealer can decide to have one more card if the total amount is lower than the player
- The dealer wins in the event of a draw
- If the player stops, the dealer gets as many turns as needed to either win or go bust
- Add a basic casino style theme to the page
